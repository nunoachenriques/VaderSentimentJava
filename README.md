# VADER Sentiment Analysis in Java

VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon
and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is _specifically attuned
to sentiments expressed in social media_.

This is an implementation of the VADER in Java. It started as a fork of the
[Java port by Animesh Pandey](https://github.com/apanimesh061/VaderSentimentJava)
of the [NLTK VADER sentiment analysis module](http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.sentiment.html#module-nltk.sentiment.vader)
written in Python ([NLTK VADER source code](http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/sentiment/vader.html))
from the [original project](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) by
the paper's author C.J. Hutto. It's the same algorithm as an improved
tool by extensive rewriting with **relevant changes**:
 
 - Android ready.
 - API and package names breaking changes.
 - Java 1.7 compatible.
 - Performance improvements (e.g., `LinkedList` where's better O() than
   `ArrayList`).

**In progress**

 - Multi-language (refer to section [Languages](#languages)).

## Citation

If you use either the data set or any of the VADER sentiment analysis
tools (VADER sentiment lexicon or Python code for rule-based sentiment
analysis engine) in your research, please cite the original paper:

## Install

### From release

https://github.com/nunoachenriques/vader-sentiment-analysis/releases

### From source code

1. Get the code from the repository (clone or download).

2. Change to the package root directory and `./gradlew installDist`.
   Notice: remember to change `gradle.properties` accordingly to your
   JDK home for 1.7 version compatibility.

3. The JAR packages will be in `build/install/vader-sentiment-analysis`
   directory.

## Testing

All tests are **100% OK** as expected!

```shell
./gradlew test
```

## Languages

To support several languages there's the `Language` interface
(`text` subpackage) to be implemented and, eventually, the `Tokenizer` too.
The **main effort** will be in all the research around the specific language
significant words, idiomatic expressions, constant and empirical values.
Moreover, a data set has to be produced and validated by humans as
_ground truth_ for testing purposes.

### English (Germanic family of languages)

The tests from the original Java port are validated against the _ground truth_
of the original Python (NLTK) implementation. The algorithm running is still the
original implementation from Hutto & Gilbert in Python and originally ported to
Java by Animesh Pandey with modifications by Nuno A. C. Henriques.

### Portuguese (Italic family of languages)

**TODO**

## Use case example

As a Java library it will easily integrate with a bit of coding.

```java
...
List<String> sentences = new LinkedList<>() {{
    add("VADER is smart, handsome, and funny.");
    add("VADER is smart, handsome, and funny!");
    add("VADER is very smart, handsome, and funny.");
    add("VADER is VERY SMART, handsome, and FUNNY.");
    add("VADER is VERY SMART, handsome, and FUNNY!!!");
    add("VADER is VERY SMART, really handsome, and INCREDIBLY FUNNY!!!");
    add("The book was good.");
    add("The book was kind of good.");
    add("The plot was good, but the characters are uncompelling and the dialog is not great.");
    add("A really bad, horrible book.");
    add("At least it isn't a horrible book.");
    add(":) and :D");
    add("");
    add("Today sux");
    add("Today sux!");
    add("Today SUX!");
    add("Today kinda sux! But I'll get by, lol");
}};

SentimentAnalysis sa = new SentimentAnalysis(new TokenizerEnglish(), new English());

for (String sentence : sentences) {
    System.out.println(sentence);
    System.out.println(sa.getSentimentAnalysis(sentence).toString());
}
...
```
