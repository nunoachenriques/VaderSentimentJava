# VADER Sentiment Analysis in Java

VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon
and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is _specifically attuned
to sentiments expressed in social media_.

This is a fork with **API and package names breaking changes** of the
[Java port by Animesh Pandey](https://github.com/apanimesh061/VaderSentimentJava)
of the
[NLTK VADER sentiment analysis module](http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.sentiment.html#module-nltk.sentiment.vader)
written in Python and optimized from the original.

 - The [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/sentiment/vader.html)
   Python source code.
 - The [Original](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) Python
   source code by the paper's author C.J. Hutto.

If you use either the data set or any of the VADER sentiment analysis
tools (VADER sentiment lexicon or Python code for rule-based sentiment
analysis engine) in your research, please cite the original paper:

## Install

### From release

https://github.com/nunoachenriques/vader-sentiment-analysis/releases

### From source code

1. Get the code from the repository (clone or download).

2. Change to the package root directory and `./gradlew installDist`.
   Notice: remember to change `gradle.properties` accordingly to your
   JDK home for 1.7 version compatibility.

3. The JAR packages will be in `build/install/vader-sentiment-analysis`
   directory.

## Testing

The tests from the original Java port are validated against the ground truth of
the original Python (NLTK) implementation. The algorithm running is still the
original implementation from Hutto & Gilbert in Python and ported to Java by
Animesh Pandey.

```shell
./gradlew test
```

## Use case example

As a Java library it will easily integrates with a bit of coding.

```java
...
ArrayList<String> sentences = new ArrayList<String>() {{
    add("VADER is smart, handsome, and funny.");
    add("VADER is smart, handsome, and funny!");
    add("VADER is very smart, handsome, and funny.");
    add("VADER is VERY SMART, handsome, and FUNNY.");
    add("VADER is VERY SMART, handsome, and FUNNY!!!");
    add("VADER is VERY SMART, really handsome, and INCREDIBLY FUNNY!!!");
    add("The book was good.");
    add("The book was kind of good.");
    add("The plot was good, but the characters are uncompelling and the dialog is not great.");
    add("A really bad, horrible book.");
    add("At least it isn't a horrible book.");
    add(":) and :D");
    add("");
    add("Today sux");
    add("Today sux!");
    add("Today SUX!");
    add("Today kinda sux! But I'll get by, lol");
}};

SentimentAnalysis sa = new SentimentAnalysis();

for (String sentence : sentences) {
    System.out.println(sentence);
    System.out.println(sa.getSentimentAnalysis(sentence).toString());
}
...
```
